# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Objective:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Activities to be done:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

My Activities:

Created a project workspace on my Macbook and set that as working directory.

 Working Directory:

 "/Users/siddharth/Desktop/Data-Scientist/DataCleaning/Data-Cleaning-Assignment"
Unzipped the data downloaded from the source mentioned above and renamed the Folder as "UCI-HAR-Dataset" where the raw data resides.

Analysed the objectives of the project and defined the data fields and functions required to clean the source Dataset and prepare the Tidy data as per the requirement of the project stated above.

A details of Data Variables, and Functions to get the objectives done are explained in a separate file CodeBook.md

Coded run_analysis.R to perform the main Job of the project.

The README.md and CodeBokk.md are authored by me to explain the functioning of run_analysis.R

Created Reopsitory on GitHub and cloned the working directory worked on the project and committed and synchornized so that Peers can evaluated my work. and pushed my work.
